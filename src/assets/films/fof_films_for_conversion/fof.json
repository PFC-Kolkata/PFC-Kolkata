Jugal and Raj, two Hindi friends, miss their last train to Amritsar, the holiest city in Punjab. They end up in a cargo wagon among illegal passengers. In flashbacks we follow Jugal’s family lost at night on the outskirts of a Punjabi village. Full of fear, they hesitantly knock at the door of an isolated house and ask for directions. Later that night, Sikh terrorists visit the same Punjabi family and give orders to kill their dog for barking and drawing attention. The next morning, paramilitary men burst into the house looking for the terrorists.",

The doctoral documentary, \"When the Tide Goes Out,\" accompanying his dissertation that examines representational absences in multimedia archive, has been selected for screening at the Vancouver International South Asian Film Festival 2022."

It does so through a people’s narrative on the preservation and regeneration of its ‘little’ traditions, which often appear seamlessly cultural and political. The film invites the audience to travel to the heart of Punjab. To enter a world of Sufi shrines worshipped and looked after by Dalits. To listen to B.S. Balli Qawwal Paslewale, the first generation Dalit Qawwals born out of this tradition. To join a fascinating dialogue with Lal Singh Dil—a radical poet, a Dalit, converted to Islam. To meet the last living legend of the Gadar movement, Baba Bhagat Singh Bilga, who contests the subversion of a common past, while affirming a new consciousness among Dalits, within and beyond Punjab. The interplay between the constituents of this mosaic brings to light the triple marginalisation of Dalits—amidst the agricultural boom that is the modern Punjab, in the contesting ground of its ‘major’ religions, and in the intellectual construction of their ‘syncretism’.'",

With the fall of the tsar in 1917, he worked as an engineer for the Red Army. In the following years, Eisenstein joined up with the Moscow Proletkult Theater as a set designer and then director. The Proletkult''s director, Vsevolod Meyerhold, became a big influence on Eisenstein, introducing him to the concept of biomechanics, or conditioned spontaneity. Eisenstein furthered Meyerhold''s theory with his own \"montage of attractions\"--a sequence of pictures whose total emotion effect is greater than the sum of its parts. He later theorized that this style of editing worked in a similar fashion to Marx''s dialectic. Though Eisenstein wanted to make films for the common man, his intense use of symbolism and metaphor in what he called \"intellectual montage\" sometimes lost his audience. Though he made only seven films in his career, he and his theoretical writings demonstrated how film could move beyond its nineteenth-century predecessor--Victorian theatre-- to create abstract concepts with concrete images.'"

					 "plot": "The film is set in a village in the outskirts of Bathinda city where villagers work in the fields of the local landlord. It is a village where people are trying hard to make peace with their existence. Daily rituals betray their simmering anger and their helplessness. The landlord has apparently sold his plots to an industry which has demolished the house of one of the villagers who refuses to vacate it. In a refined balladic manner, this atmosphere-driven film tackles the fate of the repressed family in the village. The old and ill father joins a villagers’ protest against the landlord responsible for demolishing his house. His son Melu is a rickshaw driver in a nearby town. The rickshaw pullers have gone on a strike that has turned violent. Melu, injured during a labour strike, takes to drinking and wandering the streets. On the night of the lunar eclipse, some gunshots are heard and the village is impregnated with tension. Poor and marginalized, the characters silently but emphatically emanate restlessness and discontent.",
